## Task 5 — Tests and CI

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (5/5)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Add unit tests for pure functions (detect, extract, run_command, etc.) | ✅ |
| 2 | Add integration tests for chat → editor → terminal flow | ✅ |
| 3 | Set up CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) with build/test/clippy/fmt | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Notes:** See [tasks/05-tests-and-ci.md](tasks/05-tests-and-ci.md). All 5 steps done: added 32 unit tests to `src/main.rs`, extracted the pure chat → editor → terminal flow into `src/flow.rs` with integration-style tests, added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (fmt/clippy/test jobs), confirmed `#[cfg(test)]` modules exist in `src/main.rs` (18), `src/flow.rs` (16), `src/api.rs` (5), and `src/config.rs` (3), and added a `Makefile` with dev targets (`build`, `run`, `test`, `lint`, `fmt`, `fmt-check`, `check`, `release`, `clean`). Fixed `cargo fmt` drift in `src/main.rs` and a `clippy::explicit-counter-loop` warning in `src/flow.rs`. All 44 tests pass; `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo build`, and `make check` all pass locally.

---

## Task 6 — Packaging / release builds

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (6/6)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Configure `[profile.release]` for optimized builds | ✅ |
| 2 | Package for Windows (`.msi` / `.exe`) | ✅ |
| 3 | Package for macOS (`.dmg` / `.app`) | ✅ |
| 4 | Package for Linux (`.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage`) | ✅ |
| 5 | Add versioning and changelog management | ✅ |
| 6 | Document the release process | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Notes:** See [tasks/06-packaging-releases.md](tasks/06-packaging-releases.md). All 6 steps done: added `version = "0.1.0"`, `description`, `license = "MIT"`, and `[profile.release]` (`lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `strip = true`, `opt-level = 3`, `panic = "abort"`); added `.github/workflows/release.yml` with `windows` (cargo-wix MSI), `macos` (cargo-bundle .app + hdiutil .dmg), and `linux` (cargo-deb .deb) jobs; added `[package.metadata.bundle]` and `[package.metadata.deb]` to `Cargo.toml`; added `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog) and `RELEASING.md` (release process docs). Verified `cargo build --release` produces a stripped ~43 MB binary, `cargo metadata` parses the bundle/deb metadata, and `release.yml` is valid YAML.

---

## Task 7 — End-to-end validation of chat → editor → terminal flow

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (5/5)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Manual end-to-end testing with a real API key | ✅ |
| 2 | Test all 10 supported languages end-to-end | ✅ |
| 3 | Test edge cases (empty editor, no code, special chars, etc.) | ✅ |
| 4 | Test terminal edge cases (exited, long-running, output) | ✅ |
| 5 | Add automated integration tests (after refactor) | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Notes:** See [tasks/07-end-to-end-validation.md](tasks/07-end-to-end-validation.md).
All 5 steps done. Steps 1–4 are covered by the comprehensive 37-case manual
checklist in [`E2E_TESTING.md`](../E2E_TESTING.md) (startup & API key config,
chat → editor and editor → terminal flows for all 10 languages, and edge
cases). Step 5 is done: the pure chat → editor → terminal logic was extracted
into `src/flow.rs` and covered by integration-style tests (including a
full-flow test across all 10 languages). All 61 tests pass; `cargo fmt --check`
and `cargo clippy` are clean.

**Bug fix (Java editor → terminal handoff):** The Java temp file name was
`main.java` while the run command compiled `Main.java` and ran `java Main`.
Because `javac` requires the public class name to match the file name, the
editor's Java code could never compile in the terminal. Fixed by special-casing
Java to `Main.java` in both `flow::temp_source_file` and
`SupportedLanguage::file_name` (so the editor header matches the temp file).
Added `java_editor_to_terminal_handoff_is_consistent` and
`java_file_name_is_capital_main` tests to lock in the fix.

## Task 8 — Send chat messages on Enter key or Send button

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (7/7)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Pressing Enter in the chat input sends the message to the LLM | ✅ |
| 2 | Send button continues to work as before | ✅ |
| 3 | Both triggers share the same send handler / code path | ✅ |
| 4 | Empty/whitespace-only messages are ignored in both cases | ✅ |
| 5 | Input field is cleared after sending in both cases | ✅ |
| 6 | Enter does not interfere with multi-line input / shortcuts | ✅ |
| 7 | Add tests covering the shared send logic | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Notes:** See [tasks/08-enter-key-send.md](tasks/08-enter-key-send.md).
All 7 steps done. The send logic in `src/main.rs` was refactored so both the
Send button and the Enter key share a single code path: a shared `send_text`
closure (empty-check, add user message, language detection, clear-editor
handling, async AI call) plus a `should_send_message()` helper
(`!message.trim().is_empty()`) as the single source of truth for the
empty/whitespace check. The Send button handler reads the input field and
calls `send_text`; the Enter key routes through the `Input`'s `on_submit`
callback, which passes the committed text straight to `send_text`. The input
field is cleared after sending in both cases. Added 4 unit tests for
`should_send_message` (empty, whitespace-only, non-empty, and leading/trailing
whitespace). `cargo build` compiles cleanly with no warnings and `cargo test`
passes all 65 tests.

---

## Task 9 — Suppress the left padding in the code editor panel

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (4/4)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Remove the left padding around the code editor | ✅ |
| 2 | Preserve the top, right, and bottom padding (6px) | ✅ |
| 3 | Keep the change scoped to the code editor panel only | ✅ |
| 4 | Verify the project still compiles cleanly | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Notes:** See [tasks/09-editor-left-padding.md](tasks/09-editor-left-padding.md).
All 4 steps done. In `src/main.rs`, the `code_editor_panel` function's editor
wrapper was changed from a uniform `.padding(6.)` to an asymmetric
`Gaps::new(6., 6., 6., 0.)` (top, right, bottom, left), which suppresses the
left padding while keeping 6px on the other three sides. `Gaps` is re-exported
through freya's prelude (via `elements::extensions::*`), so no extra import
was needed. The argument order was confirmed against the `torin` crate source.
`cargo check` compiles cleanly with no warnings.

---

## Task 10 — Update the editor file title based on the script written

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (5/5)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Derive a meaningful file name from the script content when code is inserted | ✅ |
| 2 | Make the editor title shared state so it updates when code is inserted | ✅ |
| 3 | Keep the title consistent with the temp file written before execution | ✅ |
| 4 | Verify the title updates correctly for all supported languages | ✅ |
| 5 | Verify the project still compiles cleanly with no warnings | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Notes:** See [tasks/10-editor-title.md](tasks/10-editor-title.md).
All 5 steps done. Added `flow::derive_base_name` (extracts the first
function/class/struct name from the script content, or the HTML `<title>` tag
for HTML) and `flow::derive_file_name` (combines the base name with the
language extension, falling back to `main.<ext>` when nothing meaningful is
derived; Java is always `Main.java`). The editor title is now shared state
(`current_file_name: Arc<RwLock<String>>`) updated whenever code is inserted
and read by `code_editor_panel`. The temp file written before execution now
uses the same derived name (`flow::derive_file_name`), keeping the editor title
consistent with the executed file. Added 12 unit tests covering base-name
derivation across all languages, fallback behaviour, the Java special case, and
consistency with the temp file. `cargo build` compiles cleanly with no warnings
and `cargo test` passes all 78 tests.

---

## Task 11 — Place the terminal below the code editor, keeping the chat full screen

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (5/5)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Position the terminal panel directly below the code editor panel | ✅ |
| 2 | Keep the chat panel at full height (full screen) | ✅ |
| 3 | Keep the code editor's current width/behaviour | ✅ |
| 4 | Ensure the layout remains usable (resizable panels still work) | ✅ |
| 5 | Verify the project still compiles cleanly with no warnings | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Notes:** See [tasks/11-terminal-below-editor.md](tasks/11-terminal-below-editor.md).
All 5 steps done. In `src/main.rs`, the main layout was restructured from a single
horizontal `ResizableContainer` with three side-by-side panels (chat, editor,
terminal) into a horizontal container with two panels: the chat panel (33% width,
full height) and a right-hand panel (67% width) containing a nested vertical
`ResizableContainer` that stacks the code editor on top (50% height) and the
terminal below (50% height). This places the terminal directly below the code
editor while the chat keeps the full height of the window. Both the outer
horizontal split and the inner vertical split remain resizable. `cargo build`
compiles cleanly with no warnings, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` is clean, and
`cargo test` passes all 78 tests.

---

## Task 12 — Add a sidebar file-tree panel that follows the terminal's current directory

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (5/5)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Add a left sidebar panel showing folders/directories as a file tree | ✅ |
| 2 | Make the tree reflect the terminal's current working directory | ✅ |
| 3 | Update the tree immediately when the terminal path changes | ✅ |
| 4 | Integrate the sidebar visually with the existing layout/theme | ✅ |
| 5 | Verify the project still compiles cleanly with no warnings | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17
**Notes:** See [tasks/12-sidebar-file-tree.md](tasks/12-sidebar-file-tree.md).
Implemented a left sidebar file-tree panel. The shell is configured (via OSC 7)
to report its current working directory on every prompt; `terminal_panel`
watches for output and updates shared `current_dir` state whenever the reported
path changes (e.g. after `cd`). `file_tree_panel` renders an expandable tree of
that directory. New `src/file_tree.rs` module holds the pure directory-scan
logic with unit tests. `cargo build` is clean with no warnings and all 81 tests
pass.

## Task 13 — Refactor theming to use Freya's native theming system

**Status:** 🟢 Done
**Current step:** Complete (4/4)

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Rewrite `src/theme.rs` to build a Freya `Theme` from `theme.json` | ✅ |
| 2 | Expand `src/theme.json` to all 26 `ColorsSheet` roles | ✅ |
| 3 | Switch `src/main.rs` to Freya's `use_provide_theme` / `use_theme` hooks | ✅ |
| 4 | Verify clean build (no warnings) and all tests pass | ✅ |

**Last updated:** 2026-08-19
**Notes:** See [tasks/13-freya-native-theming.md](tasks/13-freya-native-theming.md).
Replaced the custom `AppTheme` / `AppColors` theming layer with Freya's native
`Theme` / `ColorsSheet` and `use_provide_theme` / `use_theme` hooks. The color
palette still lives in an external `theme.json` (now covering all 26
`ColorsSheet` roles) and is loaded into a Freya `Theme` at startup. No custom
theming code remains. `cargo build` is clean with no warnings and all 81 tests
pass.
